## About The Project

This is my first cloning webpage constructed using React.js. In this project, I cloned the main page of Starbucks with the thought of assembling Lego blocks called a component in React.js.

## What to be focused on during the project

- First, I tried to carry out the component concept thoroughly by creating components as many as I can.
- Second, I attempted to find out the way to create reusable components for repeated views.
- Third, I kept on looking for something that could be split into another component.
- Lastly, I sought to copy everything up to the smallest thing in order to make users unable to tell it apart which one is real.

## Features

- Mapped objects in a JSON file to compose the main view with a variety of contents.
- Applied separate CSS style on main views by passing props from a parent component into a child component.
- Divided the layout into 4 components for managing each part separately.
- Applied proper CSS effects, such as hovering, for having them emphasized.
